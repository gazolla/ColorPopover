## Supported Platforms

- iOS 5+

## Installing

In order to install `ColorPopover`, you'll need to copy the ColorPopover folder into your Xcode project. 

### Usage

In order to use `ColorPopover`, you'll need to include the following code in your project:

    if (!self.wePopoverController) {
		
		ColorViewController *contentViewController = [[ColorViewController alloc] init];
        contentViewController.delegate = self;
		self.wePopoverController = [[WEPopoverController alloc] initWithContentViewController:contentViewController];
		self.wePopoverController.delegate = self;
		self.wePopoverController.passthroughViews = [NSArray arrayWithObject:self.navigationController.navigationBar];
		
		[self.wePopoverController presentPopoverFromRect:btn.frame
                                                inView:self.view
                              permittedArrowDirections:(UIPopoverArrowDirectionUp|UIPopoverArrowDirectionDown)
                                              animated:YES];
        
	} else {
		[self.wePopoverController dismissPopoverAnimated:YES];
		self.wePopoverController = nil;
	}


You will want to implement the method `colorPopoverControllerDidSelectColor:(NSString *)hexColor` from `ColorViewControllerDelegate` to get the result color selected. To use the color selected you should call the ` colorFromHex:(NSString *)hexColor` as the follow example:

	self.view.backgroundColor = [GzColors colorFromHex:hexColor];
